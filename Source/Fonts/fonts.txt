Font files for ROMWBW.

Compressed fonts can be created using lzsa utility.

Compress using the command line compressor by Emmanuel Marty
The compression is done as follows:

lzsa.exe -f2 -r <sourcefile> <outfile>

where option -f2 selects lzsa version 2 compression.
where option -r asks for the generation of raw (frame-less) data.

Use of compressed fonts in ROMWBW HBIOS is done through the use of the USEZLSA2 equate.

Use the following in you customer configuration to turn on font compression:

USEZLSA2	.SET	TRUE 

Original and compresses fonts in this directory:

 6,692 font8x11c.asm	; 8x11 compressed font in assembly format
 1,254 font8x11c.bin	; 8x11 compressed font in binary format
15,731 font8x11u.asm	; 8x11 uncompressed font in assembly format
 2,816 font8x11u.bin	; 8x11 uncompressed font in binary format

 7,827 font8x16c.asm	; 8x16 compressed font in assembly format
 1,467 font8x16c.bin	; 8x16 compressed font in binary format
17,920 font8x16u.asm	; 8x16 uncompressed font in assembly format
 4,096 font8x16u.bin	; 8x16 uncompressed font in binary format

 5,520 font8x8c.asm	; 8x8 compressed font in assembly format
 1,035 font8x8c.bin	; 8x8 compressed font in binary format
14,742 font8x8u.asm	; 8x8 uncompressed font in assembly format
 2,048 font8x8u.bin	; 8x8 uncompressed font in binary format

HxD hex editor was used to export the compressed bin files to a Pascal .pas file and then Notepad++ was used to reformat in asm format.
Notepad++ search/replace and column mode can be very efficient for reformatting. 
Various bin2asm utilities are around but I could not find one that worked.
