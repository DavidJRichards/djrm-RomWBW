This library contains a number of support files, programs and scripts needed
to bring up a fully functioning BPBIOS Zsystem.  These programs and files
are used and/or loaded by the startup scripts.

Some of the support files are startup ZEX scripts, some are Z3+ segment files, 
others are Date and Time stamp drivers, some are command line editors and 
history shells while others are needed to initialize the RAMDRIVE.  

The following table shows which files are needed to support each of the ten 
BPBIOS variants (BP33N, BP33T, BP33NBNK, BP33TBNK, BP34N, BP34T, BP34NBNK,
BP34TBNK, BP41NBNK & BBP41TBNK).

Instructions:
	The support files were "crunched" and stored in the library file
SUPPORT.LBR.  Place SUPPORT.LBR on the RAMDRIVE using for example
XModem. Use LBREXT with the /U option to extract and uncrunch the
files.  First extract ZEX.COM while logged onto the A: drive with the 
following command:
	B0:LBREXT SUPPORT C0:ZEX.Z?X /U
Next place all the .COM files on C15: by typing:
	B0:LBREXT SUPPORT C15:*.C?M 
The remaining files should be placed in C0:.  
	B0:LBREXT SUPPORT C0:*.Z?X /U
	B0:LBREXT SUPPORT C0:*.Z?L /U
	B0:LBREXT SUPPORT C0:*.N?R /U
	B0:LBREXT SUPPORT C0:*.Z?T /U
	B0:LBREXT SUPPORT C0:*.T?T /U

Note in all BPBIOS variants that A: is the RAMDRIVE, B: is
the ROMDRIVE and C: is the system drive.  Hard drive slices occupy C: 
through N: and floppy drives are O: & P:.  A short desciption
of each of the support files follows:

Z33N.ZEX	- Automatically executed Startup script

ZSTF.ZEX	- Automatically executed Startup script
ZPATH.COM	- Loads the Zsystem & ZSDOS search paths
jetldr.com	- Loads Zsystem segments
rcp-16h.zrl	- Zsystem Resident Command Processor
fcp-4.zrl	- Z33 Flow Control Processor (handles IF, ELSE etc)
fcp-4t.zrl	- Z34 & Z41 Flow Control Processor (handles IF, ELSE etc)
bpbioz33.ndr	- Named Directory Table for Z33
bpbio.ndr	- Named Directory Table for Z34 & Z41

FILEATTR.COM	- Enables date stamping on RAM drive.
RCOPY.COM	- Copies files listed in RAMFILES.TXT to RAMDRIVE
RAMFILES.TXT	- List of frequently used command (edit to suit)
EASE.COM	- Command line editor & history shell for Z33* 
LSH.COM		- Command line editor & history shell for Z34 & Z41

Note that clock & datestamping drivers are builtin to Z41.
