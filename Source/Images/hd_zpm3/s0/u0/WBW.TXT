This an experimental adaptation of ZPM3 for RomWBW.

Launch ZPM3 using CPMLDR.  ZPMLDR is not working reliably
at this time.

I have not found a way to make ZPM3 start up with any drive
other than A: as the system drive.  So, during the load
process, the boot drive and drive A: are "swapped" so that
the boot drive is always drive A:.  Use the ASSIGN
command after starting ZPM3 to see how the drives get
mapped.

Per ZPM3 standard, files are distributed across different
user areas depending on their usage.  Normal applications
are in user 15.  Help files in user 10.  Configuration 
files in user 14.

ZSID6.COM is the original DRI ZSID distribution, but
patched to use RST 6 instead of RST 7 to avoid conflicting
with mode 1 interrupts.
